# Home Theater Server
Easy way to build a Transmission (with web interface) and Plex server within minutes!

## Requirements
You sould need a [Docker](http://docker.com) capable computer/server. Normally with a Linux distribution should be done, otherways look to alternatives in Windows or Mac ([boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/) for example). Also you should install [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to bootstrap quickly without worring about docker commands.

## First...
Clone this repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/GerardSoleCa/docker-htserver.git
```

## Third... 
Start the whole thing! It will prompt your for your desired username and password for Transmission website

```bash
$ chmod +x 
$ ./start.sh
```

## Four...
Configure Plex. Here it's up to you to search in internet how to connect to the server, configure accounts, libraries etc. Good luck! :D
